        Pauli Spin Blockade search
The goal of the script is to find the PSB region according to the protocol described in xxx.
To do so, we fix the position in the charge stability diagram with the DC sources,
for example, it can be the charge transition region between (2,0) and (1,1). Then, we pulse
the fast AC lines with analog outputs from the OPX. The fast pulse navigates the following
regions: create a dephase/mixed state of S-T, then move along the detuning axis to cross
the (2,0) and (1,1) boundary, perform measurement along the detuning axis.

Depending on the cut-off frequency of the bias-tee, it may be necessary to adjust the barycenter (voltage offset) of each
fast pulse so that the fast line of the bias-tees sees zero voltage in average. Otherwise, the high-pass filtering effect
of the bias-tee will distort accumulates charge over time and thus distortin the charge map. A function has been written for this.

In the current implementation, the OPX is also measuring (either with DC current sensing or RF-reflectometry) during the
readout window (last segment of the triangle).
The goal is to save_all data points and plot histogram of data.

Prerequisites:
    - Readout calibration (resonance frequency for RF reflectometry and sensor operating point for DC current sensing).
    - Setting the parameters of the external DC source using its driver.
    - Connect the two plunger gates (DC line of the bias-tee) to the external dc source.
    - Connect the OPX to the fast line of the plunger gates for playing the triangle pulse sequence.

Before proceeding to the next node:
    - Identify the PSB region and update the config.
