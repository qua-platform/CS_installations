"""
        CALIBRATE DELAYS
The program consists in playing a mw pulse during a laser pulse and while performing time tagging throughout the sequence.
This allows measuring all the delays in the system.
If the counts are too high, the program might hang. In this case reduce the resolution or use
calibrate_delays_python_histogram.py if high resolution is needed.

Next steps before going to the next node:
    - Update the initial laser delay (laser_delay_1) and initialization length (initialization_len_1) in the configuration.
    - Update the delay between the laser and mw (mw_delay) and the mw length (mw_len) in the configuration.
    - Update the measurement length (meas_len_1) in the configuration.
