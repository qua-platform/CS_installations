        IQ BLOBS
This sequence involves measuring the state of the resonator 'N' times, first after thermalization (with the qubit
in the |g> state) and then after applying a pi pulse to the qubit (bringing the qubit to the |e> state) successively.
The resulting IQ blobs are displayed, and the data is processed to determine:
    - The rotation angle required for the integration weights, ensuring that the separation between |g> and |e> states
      aligns with the 'I' quadrature.
    - The threshold along the 'I' quadrature for effective qubit state discrimination.
    - The readout fidelity matrix, which is also influenced by the pi pulse fidelity.

Prerequisites:
    - Having found the resonance frequency of the resonator coupled to the qubit under study (resonator_spectroscopy).
    - Having calibrated qubit pi pulse (x180) by running qubit, spectroscopy, rabi_chevron, power_rabi and updated the config.

Next steps before going to the next node:
    - Update the rotation angle (rotation_angle) in the configuration.
    - Update the g -> e threshold (ge_threshold) in the configuration.
