"""
        READOUT OPTIMISATION: FREQUENCY
This sequence involves measuring the state of the resonator in two scenarios: first, after thermalization
(with the qubit in the |g> state) and then after applying a pi pulse to the qubit (transitioning the qubit to the
|e> state). This is done while varying the readout frequency.
The average I & Q quadratures for the qubit states |g> and |e>, along with their variances, are extracted to
determine the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR). The readout frequency that yields the highest SNR is selected as the
optimal choice.

Prerequisites:
    - Having found the resonance frequency of the resonator coupled to the qubit under study (resonator_spectroscopy).
    - Having calibrated qubit pi pulse (x180) by running qubit, spectroscopy, rabi_chevron, power_rabi and updated the state.
    - Set the desired flux bias

Next steps before going to the next node:
    - Update the readout frequency (f_opt) in the state.
    - Save the current state by calling machine.save("quam")
