"""
ALL-XY MEASUREMENT
The program consists in playing a random sequence of predefined gates after which the theoretical qubit state is known.
See [Reed's Thesis](https://rsl.yale.edu/sites/default/files/files/RSL_Theses/reed.pdf) for more details.

The sequence of gates defined below is based on https://rsl.yale.edu/sites/default/files/physreva.82.pdf-optimized_driving_0.pdf
This protocol checks that the single qubit gates (x180, x90, y180 and y90) are properly defined and calibrated and can
thus be used as a preliminary step before randomized benchmarking.

Prerequisites:
    - Having found the resonance frequency of the resonator coupled to the qubit under study (resonator_spectroscopy).
    - Having calibrated qubit pi pulse (x180) by running qubit, spectroscopy, rabi_chevron, power_rabi and updated the state.
    - Having the qubit frequency perfectly calibrated (ramsey).
    - (optional) Having calibrated the readout (readout_frequency, amplitude, duration_optimization IQ_blobs) for better SNR.
    - Set the desired flux bias.
