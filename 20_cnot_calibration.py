        RAMSEY-LIKE CHEVRON - using standard QUA (pulse > 16ns and 4ns granularity)
The goal of the script is to acquire exchange driven coherent oscillations by sweeping the idle time and detuning.
The QUA program is divided into three sections:
    1) step between the initialization, idle and measurement points using sticky elements (long timescale).
    2) apply two delta-g driven pi-half pulses separated by a low detuning pulse to increase J, using non-sticky elements (short timescale).
    3) measure the state of the qubit using either RF reflectometry or dc current sensing via PSB or Elzerman readout.
A compensation pulse can be added to the long timescale sequence in order to ensure 0 DC voltage on the fast line of
the bias-tee. Alternatively one can obtain the same result by changing the offset of the slow line of the bias-tee.

In the current implementation, the qubit pulses are played using the real-time pulse manipulation of the OPX, which is
fast and can be arbitrarily long. However, the minimum pulse length is 16ns and the sweep step must be larger than 4ns.
Also note that the qubit pulses are played at the end of the global "idle" level whose duration is fixed.

Prerequisites:
    - Readout calibration (resonance frequency for RF reflectometry and sensor operating point for DC current sensing).
    - Setting the DC offsets of the external DC voltage source.
    - Connecting the OPX to the fast line of the plunger gates.
    - Having calibrated the initialization and readout point from the charge stability map and updated the configuration.
    - Having calibrated the delta-g driven pi-half parameters (detuning level and duration).
