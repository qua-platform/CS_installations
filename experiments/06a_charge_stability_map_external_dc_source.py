        CHARGE STABILITY MAP - fast and slow axes: external source (DC)
The goal of the script is to acquire the charge stability map.
Here the charge stability diagram is acquired by sweeping the voltages using an external DC source (QDAC or else).
This is done by pausing the QUA program, updating the voltages in Python using the instrument API and resuming the QUA program.

The OPX is simply measuring, either via dc current sensing or RF reflectometry, the charge occupation of the dot.
On top of the DC voltage sweeps, the OPX can output a continuous square wave (Coulomb pulse) through the AC line of the
bias-tee. This allows to check the coupling of the fast line to the sample and measure the lever arms between the DC and
AC lines.

A single-point averaging is performed and the data is extracted while the program is running to display the results line-by-line.

Prerequisites:
    - Readout calibration (resonance frequency for RF reflectometry and sensor operating point for DC current sensing).
    - Setting the parameters of the external DC source using its driver.
    - Connect the two plunger gates (DC line of the bias-tee) to the external dc source.
    - (optional) Connect the OPX to the fast line of the plunger gates for playing the Coulomb pulse and calibrate the
      lever arm.

Before proceeding to the next node:
    - Identify the different charge occupation regions.
    - Update the config with the lever-arms.
