**Calibrations**
Programs are written to be run in parallel or sequentially depending on the boolean `multiplexed`.

A subset of the qubits/resonators can be selected, corresponding parameters relevant to the program can be pulled using `multiplexed_parser()` from the macros.py file. Furthermore, organizing tools for fetching data are located in this selection of macros.
